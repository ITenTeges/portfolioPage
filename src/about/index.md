## Who we are?

We are a micro enterprise in the IT field, providing consulting services in the programming.
We work with other companies as a contractor.
In addition, we have as a micro-firm, the micro-acquisitions of executed orders that can be admired on the home page.

## Company name

The name is supposed to refer to which industry it deals with, is easy to remember and has a humorous accent in Polish.
In my native language "IT&Teges" is pronounced as "eat and a guess" which we can be translate as "and sort of that".

## Goal

In addition to the obvious earning goal, we have other goals that we strive to achieve.
Through social media we want to educate about life-easing technologies and encourage to learn programming.
The task is simple - show that technology makes life easier and that knowledge of programming (in any degree) helps to understand the part of the world around us.
